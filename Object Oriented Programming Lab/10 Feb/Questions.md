### C++ Programming Lab Dated: 10/02/2025

### Program 1: Basic Function Definition
    Write a C++ program that defines a function sum(int a, int b) that takes two
    integers as arguments and returns their sum. Call this function from main() and display the
    result.

### Program 2: Function with Default Arguments
    Write a function calculateArea(double radius, double pi = 3.14) that
    calculates the area of a circle using the formula π * r².
    • If the user does not provide the value of pi, use 3.14 as the default.
    • Call this function with and without specifying the value of pi.

### Program 3: Function with Pass by Value and Reference
    Create two functions:
    1. squareValue(int num) → Returns the square of num (pass by value).
    2. squareReference(int &num) → Modifies num to its square (pass by reference).
    Call both functions from main() and observe the differences.

### Program 4: Recursive Function for Factorial
    Write a recursive function factorial(int n) that computes the factorial of a
    number. Call this function from main() and test it with different inputs.

### Program 5: Function Returning an Array (Using Pointers)
    Implement a function generateEvenNumbers(int n) that returns an array of the first
    n even numbers.
    Use dynamic memory allocation (new keyword).
    Call the function from main() and display the array elements.

### Program 6: Function Pointer Implementation
    Define a function int add(int a, int b). Create a function pointer that can store
    the address of this function and call it using the pointer.

### Program 7: Function to Reverse a String
    Implement a function reverseString(string &str) that reverses a string in-place
    using pass by reference.
    Example:
    Input: "hello"
    Output: "olleh"
