### C++ Programming Lab Dated :-11/11/2024

### Program 1: Basic if Statement
	Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and checks if it is positive, negative, or
	zero using if, else if, and else statements. Print the result accordingly.
### Program2: Nested if Statements
	Write a program that takes a user’s age as input and uses nested if statements to determine and
	print whether the person is a child (age < 12), teenager (age between 12 and 18), adult (age
	between 18 and 60), or senior (age > 60).
### Program3: if Statement with Multiple Conditions
	Create a program that takes two integer inputs and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /) from the
	user, then performs the corresponding operation. Use if, else if, and else statements to
	handle each case and print the result.
### Program4: switch Statement for Days of the Week
	Write a program that takes a number between 1 and 7 from the user and uses a switch statement
	to print the corresponding day of the week (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.). Print "Invalid
	input" if the number is not between 1 and 7.
### Program5: switch Statement for Basic Calculator
	Write a program that takes two integers and a character representing an operation (+, -, *, /) as
	input from the user and uses a switch statement to perform the appropriate arithmetic operation
	and print the result.
### Program6: Nested switch Statements for a Menu
	Create a menu-based program where the user can choose between "Vegetarian" and "Non-
	Vegetarian" options, then display a sub-menu with specific dishes based on the selection. Use
	nested switch statements to handle each menu and sub-menu option.
### Program7: Grading System using if-else Statements
	Write a program that takes a student's score (out of 100) as input and displays the grade based on
	the following criteria:
		• A: 90-100
		• B: 80-89
		• C: 70-79
		• D: 60-69
		• F: Below 60
	Use if-else statements for this.
### Program8: switch Statement for Month and Days
	Write a program that takes an integer from the user representing the month (1 for January, 2 for
	February, etc.) and uses a switch statement to print the number of days in that month. Consider
	leap year (assume it is a leap year if February is chosen) and handle it with an additional check.
### Program9: for Loop with if Statement for Prime Number Check
	Write a program that takes an integer as input and uses a for loop with an if statement to check
	if the number is prime. If it’s prime, print "Prime Number"; otherwise, print "Not a Prime
	Number."
### Program10: switch Statement for Character Analysis
	Write a program that takes a single character as input from the user and uses a switch statement
	to check if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u for both uppercase and lowercase) or a
	consonant. Print the result accordingly.
