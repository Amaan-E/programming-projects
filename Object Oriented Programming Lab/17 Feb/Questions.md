### Object Oriented Programming Lab 3rd Semester Dated: 17/02/2025

### Program 1: Create a Simple Class - Circle Area Calculation
    Define a class Circle with an attribute radius.
    Implement a function calculateArea() to compute and return the area of the circle.
    Create an object, set the radius, and display the area.

### Program 2: Class with Private Data Members and Getter/Setter Functions - Rectangle Area Calculation
    Create a Rectangle class with private attributes length and width.
    Implement setter and getter functions.
    Calculate and display the area using calculateArea().

### Program 3: Constructor and Destructor in a Class - Triangle Area Calculation
    Define a Triangle class with a constructor to initialize base and height.
    Implement a function calculateArea() using the formula: 
    		Area = 1 / 2 * base * height
    Implement a destructor to display a message when an object is destroyed.

### Program 4: Parameterized Constructor and Default Constructor - Perimeter of a Rectangle
    Create a Rectangle class with attributes length and width.
    Implement a default constructor that initializes values to zero.
    Implement a parameterized constructor to accept values.
    Calculate and display the perimeter using calculatePerimeter().

### Program 5: Class with Multiple Objects - Volume Calculation of Cubes
    Define a Cube class with an attribute side.
    Implement a function calculateVolume() using the formula: Volume = side3
    Create multiple objects with different side values and display their volumes.

### Program 6: Overloading Constructor in a Class - Area of Circle and Rectangle
    Define a Shape class with a default constructor and an overloaded constructor.
    If radius is given, calculate the area of a circle.
    If length and breadth are given, calculate the area of a rectangle.

### Program 7: Class with Function Returning Object - Adding Two Complex Numbers
    Define a Complex class with attributes real and imaginary.
    Implement a function addComplex() that takes another Complex object and returns a
    new Complex object with the sum of two complex numbers.
    Display the result.

### Program 8: Copy Constructor Implementation - Distance between Two Points
    Create a Point class with attributes x and y.
    Implement a copy constructor to initialize an object from another object.
    Implement a function calculateDistance(Point p2) using the formula:.

### Program 9: Using this Pointer in a Class - Basic Arithmetic Operations
    Define a Calculator class with attributes num1 and num2.
    Implement a function setValues() .
    Implement functions add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide().

### Program 10: Function Overloading in a Class - Finding Maximum Number
    Define a MaxFinder class with overloaded functions:
        o findMax(int, int) for two integers.
        o findMax(double, double) for two floating-point numbers.
        o findMax(int, int, int) for three integers.
    Display the maximum of given numbers.
