### Object Oriented Programming Lab Dated: 25/11/2024

### Program 1: If-Else with Logical Operators
Write a program that checks whether a given year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if:
- It is divisible by 4,
- But not divisible by 100,
- Unless it is also divisible by 400.
The program should handle invalid inputs gracefully.

### Program 2: Nested If-Else with Range Checking
Write a program that calculates income tax based on the following slabs:
- Income <= ₹2,50,000: No tax
- ₹2,50,001 - ₹5,00,000: 5%
- ₹5,00,001 - ₹10,00,000: 20%
- Above ₹10,00,000: 30%
The program should accept an annual income as input and output the tax amount.

### Program 3: Switch Statement with Functions
Create a simple calculator using a switch statement. The program should ask the user to input two numbers and a choice of operation (+, -, *, /, %). Implement each operation in a separate function and call the appropriate function based on the user's input.

### Program 4: For Loop with Advanced Patterns
Write a program that generates the following pyramid pattern for a given number of rows `n`:
	 1
    1 2
   1 2 3
  1 2 3 4
 1 2 3 4 5
 
Use nested loops and appropriate spacing for alignment.

### Program 5: While Loop with Prime Numbers
Write a program that accepts a number `n` and prints all prime numbers less than or equal to `n`. Use a while loop and a function to check if a number is prime.

### Program 6: Do-While with Number Reversal
Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to input a positive integer and then reverses the digits of the number. For example, input `1234` should output `4321`. Stop the program when the user enters `0`.

### Program 7: Break and Continue with Nested Loops
Write a program to find and print all pairs `(x, y)` such that:
- \( x^2 + y^2 = n \)
where `n` is an input number, and both `x` and `y` range from `0` to \(\sqrt{n}\). Use break and continue statements to optimize the solution.

### Program 8: Pattern Generation with Conditional Statements
Write a program to print a checkerboard pattern of size `n x n`:
# # # #
# # # #
# # # #
# # # #
Use nested loops and an if-else condition to determine whether to print `#` or a space.

### Program 9: Menu-Driven Program with Loops
Create a menu-driven program that allows the user to perform the following operations repeatedly:
1. Find the factorial of a number.
2. Find the GCD of two numbers.
3. Find the LCM of two numbers.
4. Exit the program.
Implement the menu using a loop and appropriate control structures.

### Program 10: Nested Control Statements with Arrays
Write a program to find all subsets of an array whose sum equals a given target value.
- **Input:** Array of integers and a target sum.
- **Output:** All subsets (in any order) that sum up to the target.
For example:
- **Input:** `[2, 3, 5]`, Target = `5`
- **Output:** `[2, 3]` and `[5]`
